# NexusYield

**Intelligent Agronomy Engine**

An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts crop yield (Tons / Hectare) based on environmental parameters and intervention strategies. Wait, what does it mean? It provides real-time decisions through a production-grade Streamlit dashboard — built to mirror how modern agritech teams evaluate harvest probability.

---

## Problem Statement

Predicting agricultural yields is complex, reliant on non-linear weather patterns, soil composition, and farming techniques. Traditional rule-based farming estimates miss subtle synergies between variables.

This project builds a **complete prediction pipeline**: from raw agronomy data to a deployable web interface that an agricultural analyst or farmer could use to evaluate a field yield in under 30 seconds, with transparent feature importance impact.

## Features

- **Full ML Pipeline** — data ingestion, preprocessing (scaling & dummy encoding), model training, evaluation, and serving
- **Explainability** — Feature importance matrix analysis for every prediction 
- **Production UI** — dark-themed, animated glassmorphism dashboard built with Streamlit
- **Intervention Evaluation** — toggle chemical fertilizer and active irrigation parameters
- **Deployment-Ready** — absolute path resolution, single-command launch
